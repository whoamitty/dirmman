# What is mman ?



mman allows you to quickly access
from anywhere to your scripts in ~/bin,
display their content,
or make personal manuals about them with vim .

I will make a more detailed description soon.


For have command mman
put this command in your ~/.bashrc
`source path/to/dirmman/mman.sh`
