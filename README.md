# What is mman ?



mman allows you to quickly access
quickly to your scripts in bin,
display their content,
or make personal manuals with vim,
but also to print them.

I will make a more detailed description soon.


For have command mman
run this command
put dirmman for exemple in `~/git_source/`
and make a link in `/usr/bin/` to `mman` 
`sudo ln -s  ~/git_source/dirmman/mman  /usr/bin/mman`
